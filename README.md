Overview

[Provide a brief description of what your project is about and what problems it aims to solve.] 

[Insert app name] will be an online platform that connects international students in the United States with opportunities that they are eligible for. Every year, International students waste time and effort applying for opportunities they may qualify for but end up not getting because they aren’t eligible. Instead of going through a mostly rigorous interview process and ending up not being eligible, this app helps keep this process more streamlined and transparent for international students.
